# frontend-ui-architecture

**Version:** 1.1.0 (2026-09-20) · Files: `SKILL.md` (core decision tables), `nextjs.md` (App Router boundaries and data layer) · Enforced by `cd client && pnpm arch`

## Motivation

Two existing skills touch code organization only in passing. `react-best-practices` gives it five lines, and `next-best-practices` documents App Router *file conventions*. Neither answers the everyday questions: where a new hook, constant, helper or business rule goes, when local code becomes shared, and how to split a big component.

This skill answers those questions as a **classify → place → split** recipe, keyed to observable predicates (what the code knows, how many consumers it has). Performance is out of scope on purpose.

### Scope split with sibling skills

| Topic | Owner |
|---|---|
| Where code lives, shared vs local, component splitting, dependency direction, barrels, `'use client'` / `server-only` as a boundary | **frontend-ui-architecture** |
| Hooks misuse, state anti-patterns, render performance | `react-best-practices` |
| App Router file conventions, RSC serialization, data-fetching APIs, metadata, images/fonts | `next-best-practices` |
| Schema API details | `zod` |

## How it was built (TDD for skills)

1. **Research:** three parallel Sonnet agents covered React structure, non-UI code placement, and Next.js architecture. Every URL below was fetched and verified live.
2. **RED:** three Sonnet agents answered placement scenarios without the skill: a new feature, a 650-line component refactor, and shared-vs-local decisions. Baseline was already decent (colocation, RSC-first). The recurring gaps:
   - Business rules (run cost + price table) placed in a UI component's `helpers.ts`.
   - UI mappings (severity → color) mixed into domain `lib/<entity>/` modules.
   - A single-consumer query hook put in global `lib/hooks/` "because that's where hooks go".
   - No stated dependency direction and no demotion rule.
   - API types hand-written instead of inferred from the contract schema.
3. **GREEN:** with the skill loaded, the same scenarios closed every baseline gap. Run cost + pricing moved to a React-free `_lib/model.ts`, `severityColor` moved to the UI layer, `Pr` became `z.infer` of the contract, and single-consumer hooks and data modules were colocated. One agent went further and moved tab state into the URL, which removed `'use client'` from the tab bar.
4. **REFACTOR:** the GREEN agents reported friction points, and each was closed in the text:
   - "Same route" was ambiguous. The skill now uses a nearest-common-ancestor rule for sibling routes like `pulls/` and `pulls/[number]/`.
   - No path was named for the shared UI layer.
   - There was no kind for URL/form input parsers.
   - Business thresholds and display limits weren't distinguished.
   - Data-module granularity (entity + sub-collections), exporting key factories for invalidation, and isomorphic resource modules weren't covered.
   - Tabs over one form lost edits on unmount.
   - The i18n namespace for sub-features wasn't specified.

## Where sources disagree (and how the skill resolves it)

| Question | Positions | Skill's resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Feature-based vs type-based top-level folders | bulletproof-react, FSD and Wieruch go feature-first. Comeau groups by technical role and argues feature boundaries drift. React docs: "don't spend more than 5 minutes". | Doesn't mandate a top-level scheme. The **promotion rule** (1 consumer → local, 2+ features → shared) and one-way dependencies work under both. |
| Barrel `index.ts` | TkDodo: avoid, except at a package entry point (11k→3.5k modules in a Next.js app). bulletproof-react: avoid even for features. Comeau: a thin per-component `index.ts` is fine. | Thin per-folder `index.ts` is allowed. Hub barrels are banned. **dev-digest** requires `index.ts` in every `_components/<Name>/`, which is the allowed thin form, so there is no conflict. |
| Route-level colocation vs central `src/features/` in Next.js | Makerkit and Codelynx colocate under `app/<route>/_components`/`_lib`. bulletproof-react and FSD keep `app/` routing-only. The Next.js docs accept both. | Follow the project convention (dev-digest: route-level `_components/`). Thin `page.tsx` either way. |
| Where Server Actions live | Centralized `lib/actions/<domain>.ts` vs colocated `actions.ts`. | Either works. Actions must be thin and must re-check auth. (dev-digest has no Server Actions, because the backend is Fastify.) |
| How eagerly to name constants | "Name every magic value" vs "a self-evident one-scope literal doesn't need a name". | Name it once it is non-obvious or reused. Keep it with its only consumer. |

**Settled for dev-digest (2026-09-20):** `client/src/lib/hooks/` was an `export *` hub over five files with inline query keys. The refactor in `docs/cc-plans/2026-09-19+frontend-architecture-refactor.md` replaced it with `lib/api/<resource>.ts` modules, each owning its fetchers, exported key factory and hooks. A hook with a single consumer still belongs next to that consumer, not in `lib/api/`.

## Changelog

- **1.1.0 (2026-09-20)** — dependency direction and barrel rules are now enforced by `cd client && pnpm arch` (dependency-cruiser, `client/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`): `shared-not-importing-app` (`src/lib`/`src/components` → `src/app`), `no-cross-route-internals` (sibling top-level routes reaching into each other's `_components`/`_lib`), `no-circular`, `no-orphans`, and `vendor-is-leaf`. Existing violations freeze in `.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json`; never regenerate that baseline to make a new violation pass.
- **1.0.0 (2026-09-19)** — initial version: classify/place/split recipe, Next.js boundaries and data layer, barrels policy, red flags.
