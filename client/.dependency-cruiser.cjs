/**
 * Frontend architecture enforcement (client).
 *
 * See `.claude/skills/frontend-ui-architecture/SKILL.md` for the placement
 * rules this config checks (shared → features → app, no sibling-route
 * imports, vendor stays a leaf). Run with `pnpm arch` (ignores the
 * baselined violations in `.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json`) or
 * `pnpm arch:baseline` to regenerate that baseline after a deliberate,
 * reviewed change.
 *
 * Never regenerate the baseline to make a NEW violation pass — fix the
 * import instead. The baseline exists only to freeze violations that
 * predate this config, so `pnpm arch` can be green on day one.
